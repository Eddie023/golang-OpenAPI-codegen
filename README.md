## Technical Overview 
1. API Specification are described in 'openapi.yaml' file which follows OpenAPI 3.1 standard. 
2. API types are autogenerated from 'openapi.yaml' file using [oapi-codegen](github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/cmd/oapi-codegen) pkg. 
3. HTTP service is built using Go Chi Router. 
4. File 'pkg/api/transaction.go' contains Handler code for our two APIs
5. Package 'pkg/api/service' contains business logic required for our two APIs
6. Postgres DB is used as persistence layer and is dockerized in the codebase. 
7. [ent.go](https://entgo.io/) is used as ORM framework 

## Running the application 
1. copy .env.example and create .env file with given environment variables.
1. Run "docker compose up" to initiate a postgres instance. 
2. Run "make run" command to run a go server 
3. Make curl request for new purchase transaction using "make post"
4. Get the transaction Id from output of POST request and use that to make GET request!
